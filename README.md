## Introduction
Welcome to the Kitten Father aka Abu Hurairah Website! ðŸŒŸ

This site is to explore the life, teachings, and profound wisdom of Abu Hurairah, a key companion of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). This website is a curated tribute, offering a glimpse into the rich legacy and contributions of Abu Hurairah to Islamic tradition. Whether you're a scholar seeking in-depth knowledge or a curious learner eager to discover, my platform provides a comprehensive resource on the remarkable journey of Abu Hurairah. Join me on this enlightening exploration!


## Features
The website have 3 pages, Home, Biography and Contact(which will be redirect by get method to another link(which for the moment used hidden page called tahnkyou.html) since I made this project only with HTML5 and CSS3 as shown on the tables below)


- **Navigation Bar:** 
The navigation bar is on all three pages. It has links to the Logo, Home page, Biography, and Contact page. The navigation bar looks the same on every page, making it easy to move around.


- **Home:**
The landing page with image/photgraph and overlay text
- **Biography:**
This page is the biography of the kitten father aka abu hurairah. 
This page will have 2 pictures and a video. The video is set to mute and paused, allowing the user to click play and unmute it for a better experience. This way, the user can read the biography first and then choose to listen and watch the video, reducing unnecessary clicks for the user.
- **Contact:**
This page is centered around a contact form. It requires the user to provide their name, surname, email, and information in a textarea. After completing the form, the user will be directed to a concealed "thank you" page.

- **Thankyou:** [click here to view](https://bryaro.github.io/Portfolio-1-CodeInstitute/thankyou.html)
This approach is due to the usage of only HTML5 and CSS3 without involving other languages like JavaScript to handle request. But if javascript was involved then this would been sendig a request after send message submit clicked by the user.

## Table of Contents

| Pages | Name |

|     1| Home        |
|     2| Biography   |

The thankyou.html is only to redirect the user to a get request to later use it using with different language e.g javascript

## Testing
#### Validator testing for HTML
 - **homepage:** Result was green with **No Errors** Errors but void elements. used [W3C html Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbryaro.github.io%2FPortfolio-1-CodeInstitute%2F)

#### Validator testing for CSS
- **CSS:**
Result was green with **No Errors** but warning about imported google fonts [W3C css validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fbryaro.github.io%2FPortfolio-1-CodeInstitute%2Fassets%2Fcss%2Fstyle.css&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### Lighthouse
![](/assets/documentations/lighthousekittenfather.png)
![](/assets/documentations/lighthousekittenfather2.png)
I've concentrated primarily on accessibility while also giving due attention to best practices, SEO, and performance.

### Wave Webaim - accessibility testing
I've used toggle isntead of javascript and it doesnt give error here because I've added aria-label to the input and the label. but it should give two errors if the aria-label removed. this is because I am using only html and css for respoinsive deisgn.

### Manual Testing




| Feature being tested | Expected Outcome | Testing Performed | Actual Outcome | Result (Pass or fail) |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| HTML5 | No Error| Yes | 3 Errors | No Error |
| CSS | No Error| Yes | No Error | No Error |

Unfortunately, screenshots were not captured for the HTML validator, but there were three identified errors, namely: 
- Footer: n the footer the list < li > had all the following < l > missing the i before ending of the element. 
- Header: had extra ending of an anchor
- incorrect pathway to images since when deployed the pathway is not as on the computer. had to add ../ to images and media in order for the github pages to find the source of assets.


## Codeanywhere and GitPod forking repository

I used Cloud based IDE, codeanywhere half of the project, but it seemed to be very slow and was keep lagging and so did a bit research on google and slack team. Some recomended me to use gitpod. Tried it and it instantly changed the speed of my deplyment process.
