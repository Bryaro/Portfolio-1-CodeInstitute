Welcome to [The Kitten Father website ](https://bryaro.github.io/Portfolio-1-CodeInstitute/)

## Introduction
Welcome to the Kitten Father aka Abu Hurairah Website! ðŸŒŸ

This site is to explore the life, teachings, and profound wisdom of Abu Hurairah, a key companion of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). This website is a curated tribute, offering a glimpse into the rich legacy and contributions of Abu Hurairah to Islamic tradition. Whether you're a scholar seeking in-depth knowledge or a curious learner eager to discover, my platform provides a comprehensive resource on the remarkable journey of Abu Hurairah. Join me on this enlightening exploration!


## Features
The website have 3 pages, Home, Biography and Contact(which will be redirect by get method to another link(which for the moment used hidden page called tahnkyou.html) since I made this project only with HTML5 and CSS3 as shown on the tables below)


- **Navigation Bar:** 
The navigation bar is on all three pages. It has links to the Logo, Home page, Biography, and Contact page. The navigation bar looks the same on every page, making it easy to move around.


- **Home:**
The landing page with image/photgraph and overlay text
![](/assets/documentations/Landingpage.png)
- **Biography:**
This page is the biography of the kitten father aka abu hurairah. 
This page will have 2 pictures and a video. The video is set to mute and paused, allowing the user to click play and unmute it for a better experience. This way, the user can read the biography first and then choose to listen and watch the video, reducing unnecessary clicks for the user.

- **Contact:**
This page is centered around a contact form. It requires the user to provide their name, surname, email, and information in a textarea. After completing the form, the user will be directed to a concealed "thank you" page.

- **Thankyou:** [click here to view](https://bryaro.github.io/Portfolio-1-CodeInstitute/thankyou.html)
This approach is due to the usage of only HTML5 and CSS3 without involving other languages like JavaScript to handle request. But if javascript was involved then this would been sendig a request after send message submit clicked by the user.

## Table of Contents

| Pages | Name |
|-----:|-----------  |
|     1| Home        |
|     2| Biography   |
|     3| Contact     |
|     4| thankyou    |

The thankyou.html is only to redirect the user to a get request to later use it using with different language e.g javascript


| Count | Lanuages |
|-----:|-----------  |
|     1| HTML5       |
|     2| CSS3        |

### Wave Webaim - accessibility testing
I've used toggle isntead of javascript and it doesnt give error here because I've added aria-label to the input and the label. but it should give two errors if the aria-label removed. this is because I am using only html and css for respoinsive deisgn.
![Webwave test screenshot](/assets/documentations/Webwave.png)

### Manual Testing
Starting with the home page by intially checking all the resolution and the responsivness on as many devices as possible that I have had at home for each page. Testing the nav bar button, when clicked menu of nav bar is showen by dropdown. Each nav page withing the dropdown visible and clickable. Cliking the nav bar favicon the navbar moves back and only the favicon is shown so that the user can easy click on it. The same test on the nav bar was repeated on each apge on different devices and works amazingly! The dropdown menu tested, click on homepage takes us to home page, click on biography takes us to biography page, click on contact taking us to the contact form. 

The contact form filed and the requirement for the input tested and works great for the input of email as well for the textarea. When the send message button clicked the submission is opening the tahnkyou page. I didnt want to use target="_blank" in the thank you page but if the case and  purpose was to redirect the user to a new tab, then we would have add target="_blank" to the element, however so we se the following:
see thank you page [here](/assets/documentations/thankyoupageScreenshot.png)
inside the page when click "here" as shown on the thank you page will redirect the user back to the home page. All tests was done for every section of every page.

| Feature being tested | Expected Outcome | Testing Performed | Actual Outcome | Result (Pass or fail) |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| HTML5 | No Error| Yes | No Error | Pass |
| CSS | No Error| Yes | No Error | Pass |

Unfortunately, screenshots were not captured for the HTML validator, but there were three identified errors, namely: 
- Footer: n the footer the list < li > had all the following < l > missing the i before ending of the element. 
- Header: had extra ending of an anchor
- incorrect pathway to images since when deployed the pathway is not as on the computer. had to add ../ to images and media in order for the github pages to find the source of assets.


## Codeanywhere and GitPod forking repository

I used Cloud based IDE, codeanywhere half of the project, but it seemed to be very slow and was keep lagging and so did a bit research on google and slack team. Some recomended me to use gitpod. Tried it and it instantly changed the speed of my deplyment process.
Cloning the Repository using cloud based IDE Codeanywehre or Gitpod.

### if using *Codeanywhere* IDE:
Open Codeanywhere:

Log in to your Codeanywhere account.
Create a New Container:

Create a new container and choose a stack or use an existing one.
Open Terminal:

Within your container, open the terminal.
Clone the Repository:

Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL to clone it into your Codeanywhere workspace.

### if using *GitPod* IDE:
Open Gitpod:

If you're using Gitpod, navigate to the Gitpod website.
Prefix Repository URL:

Add the repository URL in the browser's address bar and press Enter. This opens the repository in a Gitpod workspace. actually almost similar to Codeanywehere cloud based IDE

Forking the Repository:
Using Codeanywhere IDE or Gitpod IDE:
Visit GitHub:

Open your web browser and go to the GitHub page of the repository you want to fork.
Click on "Fork":

Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
Running the Site Locally:
