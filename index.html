                    <h3>Teaching of being nice to all beings</h3>
                    <p>"In every alms given to creatures who have a heart (heart) that is wet (live) will get a good reward. A Muslim who grows
                    plants or herbs which are then eaten by birds, humans or animals, then for him as charity." - Authentic hadith narrated by Bukhari
                    
                    This hadith gives us an understanding that giving food or drink to animals is part of the charity and therefore whoever
                    does this will get a reward from our creator Allah.</p>

                    <h3>Train Us To Become Responsible Persons</h3>
                    <p>In Islam, responsibility is one of the important aspects of daily life. By taking care of a cat, we will learn how to be
                    responsible starting from providing food, water, providing a proper bed, to keeping the cat healthy.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Cleanliness and Purity</h3>
                    <p>
                    Islam places a strong emphasis on cleanliness and purity. Cats are considered clean animals, and their fur is not
                    considered impure. In Islamic tradition, it is not required to wash a vessel that a cat has drunk from, unlike some
                    other animals.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Protection from Harm</h3>
                    <p>Keeping a cat in the house can bring blessings and protection from harm. It is said
                    that cats have a natural ability to sense the presence of jinn (supernatural beings), and their presence can help guard
                    against negative influences.</p>
